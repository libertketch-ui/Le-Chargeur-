The previous AI engineer incrementally built the BusConnect Cameroun application, evolving it through several stages based on user feedback. Initially, the codebase was a minimal React/FastAPI Hello World app, despite the user's problem statement describing a fully-featured FlixBus-style application. The AI engineer identified this discrepancy and received explicit instructions to implement all described features.

Development proceeded in phases: first, a comprehensive backend and frontend were built for FlixBus-style functionalities (navigation, real-time tracking, baggage, promotions). This was followed by integration of advanced features inspired by Yandex Yango and Bolt (multi-service classes, advanced booking, parcel delivery). Subsequently, the application was fused with TicketCam features, focusing on mobile money payments and a refined UI. The latest major addition was a multi-level registration system with document uploads and admin validation. Finally, the app was rebranded Connect237 with extensive features like real-time weather, tourist images, detailed payment options, and communication integrations. While many API endpoints were successfully tested via cURL and frontend interfaces captured, some backend APIs (parcel delivery, smart AI search, admin dashboard) explicitly reported errors and were not fully resolved before the latest user requests. The current task is to perform a comprehensive audit and finalize all previously specified requirements, particularly the multi-level registration system.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested an application named BusConnect Cameroun with a rich set of FlixBus-inspired features, including improved navigation (5 tabs: Search, Live Tracking, My Tickets, Offers, Profile), real-time tracking, advanced baggage management, promotional offers, and a professional UI. This included 120+ cities, Haversine distance calculations, and multi-level user registration (Client, Agency, Transporter).

Subsequently, the user requested integration of features from Yandex Yango (multiple service classes, smart destination suggestions, multi-stop trips, referral, interactive maps) and Bolt (advance booking, safety features, premium subscriptions, ratings, customer support, inter-city parcel delivery).

Later, functionalities from TicketCam were to be merged, specifically Mobile Money payment (Orange/MTN logos), a clean landing page design with popular routes, and a mobile-first UX.

Finally, the application was to be renamed Connect237 and enhanced with: an excellent logo, real-time city weather forecasts, Cameroonian tourist images, customizable passenger count, user-defined travel hour/pickup points via maps, a flexible payment system (500 FCFA reservation, balance on-site), integrated calculator, various payment modes (credit, vouchers, Mobile Money with logos), redirection to a numeric keypad for payments, and integration with WhatsApp, Google Mail, and customer service for chat/calls. The registration system needs to handle agencies, individual transporters, occasional transporters, and clients, requiring document uploads (authorization, driver's license, vehicle photos), administrative validation, and SMS/Email verification for valid phone numbers or email addresses.

<code_architecture>



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, defining all FastAPI routes, data models, business logic, and database interactions.
    -   **Changes Made**: This file has been extensively rewritten multiple times. Initially, it was a minimal status check. It was expanded to include full FlixBus-style features (users, routes, bookings, offers, baggage, tracking), then integrated Yango/Bolt features (service classes, advanced booking, parcel delivery), followed by TicketCam fusion (popular routes), a multi-level registration system, and finally all Connect237 features (weather, smart search, payment integration, communication). It now contains comprehensive CRUD operations and complex logic for an advanced transport application.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component and entry point for the user interface, responsible for overall layout, navigation, and integrating other components.
    -   **Changes Made**: Started as a Hello World component. It was first completely rewritten to implement the FlixBus-style UI with 5 navigation tabs. Subsequently, it was updated to incorporate Yango/Bolt features, then replaced with  for TicketCam integration, and finally replaced with  to reflect the Connect237 branding and all its features. It also handles routing and integrates components like  and .
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains global styles for the application, likely utilizing Tailwind CSS directives.
    -   **Changes Made**: Rewritten to implement a professional, FlixBus-inspired design, and later adapted for the Connect237 aesthetic.
-   **/app/frontend/src/RegistrationSystem.js**:
    -   **Importance**: A newly created React component dedicated to the multi-level user registration process.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains the UI and logic for different user types (client, agency, transporter), handling document uploads, and contact verification.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App_Fusion.js**:
    -   **Importance**: A temporary file created to merge TicketCam features into the main .
    -   **Changes Made**: Created with UI elements and logic for TicketCam integrations, then its content was used to replace .
-   **/app/frontend/src/Connect237App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: A newly created React component representing the final Connect237 application interface.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains the UI and integration of all the latest features, including weather, tourist images, expanded payment options, and communication links. Its content was used to replace .
-   **/app/frontend/src/PaymentKeypad.js**:
    -   **Importance**: A new component for the numeric keypad payment interface.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implements the UI and logic for processing Mobile Money and other payments, displaying merchant codes and total prices.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Error: Parcel Delivery API**: The  endpoint returned a Pydantic validation error (Field required). This needs debugging and correction in .
-   **Backend Error: Smart AI Search API**: The  endpoint returned Invalid HTTP request received. This also requires investigation and fix in .
-   **Backend Error: Admin Dashboard API**: The  endpoint returned an Internal Server Error. This is critical for administrative validation of user registrations and needs to be resolved.
-   **Comprehensive Audit**: A full audit of all implemented features against the user's detailed requirements for Connect237 is explicitly requested and pending.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of finalizing the Connect237 application. The application had undergone rebranding and significant feature additions based on the user's extensive requirements, including weather forecasts, tourist images, custom passenger counts, advanced payment systems with Mobile Money integration and a numeric keypad, and integrated communication options.

The AI had rewritten  to incorporate these new backend functionalities and created new frontend components like  and , subsequently integrating them by replacing the main .

The user's last messages (Chat Messages 154, 157, 160) explicitly asked Est ce que tout y est (Is everything there?), requested an audit and lien pour impl√©menter (link to implement), and reiterated the detailed registration requirements. The AI engineer confirmed they would perform a complete audit and finalize the implementation according to all specifications. The current state is that many features are theoretically implemented, but a formal verification and debugging of known API issues are still required.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Conduct a comprehensive audit of all implemented features and address the known backend API errors (Parcel Delivery, Smart AI Search, Admin Dashboard).
