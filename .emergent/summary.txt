The AI engineer's work on Connect237 has been highly iterative, responding to evolving user requirements. Initially, the project expanded from a Hello World app to a comprehensive transport platform, integrating features from FlixBus, Yango/Bolt, and TicketCam. Key phases involved building out a robust backend with multi-level registration, advanced booking, and real-time services, alongside a dynamic React frontend. Significant challenges included debugging several missing or broken backend API endpoints (parcel delivery, smart AI search, admin dashboard, weather routing), resolving frontend rendering errors (e.g., Building is not defined), and continually adapting the administrative hierarchy for destination selection based on precise user input. Payment methods, tourist content, and branding were also refined multiple times. The AI engineer consistently addressed specific user feedback, resulting in a functionally rich application, currently focused on refining administrative data and implementing full multi-language support.

The user requested BusConnect Cameroun, a FlixBus-style app with 5 tabs, real-time tracking, baggage, promotions, 120+ cities, Haversine calculations, and multi-level registration (Client, Agency, Transporter). This expanded to include Yandex Yango/Bolt features: multi-service classes, smart suggestions, multi-stop trips, parcel delivery, advance booking, and safety. Later, TicketCam mobile money payments and a clean landing page were added. The app was rebranded Connect237, needing a new logo, real-time city weather, Cameroonian tourist images, customizable passenger counts, map-based travel points, flexible payments (500 FCFA reservation, balance on-site), integrated calculator, various payment modes, numeric keypad redirection, and WhatsApp/Email/Call integrations. Registration requires document uploads and admin validation. Recent requests include: fixing destination selection errors, adding real transport agencies, auto-rotating tourist images with names, all Cameroonian villages/arrondissement capitals as search points, admin car management, wallet feature, Paiement sur place option, 500 FCFA reservation per passenger, real-time transporter prices, FR/EN language switch, KetchFlex branding, and full English translation.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Application**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs ( prefix), UUIDs for IDs.
- **Frontend Framework**: React 19, JSX, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI.
- **Data Management**: MongoDB (UUIDs, ISO strings for datetime).
- **Environment Variables**: Strict usage for , .
- **Service Management**: Supervisor for background processes.
- **Administrative Structure**: Hierarchical selection (Region, Department, City/Chef-lieu).
- **Internationalization**: Language selection (FR/EN).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

- **/app/backend/server.py**:
    - **Importance**: Defines all backend logic, API routes, data models, and database interactions (MongoDB).
    - **Changes Made**: Extensively modified. Added new API endpoints (e.g., for parcel delivery, smart AI search, admin dashboard, registration validation, administrative structure retrieval). Corrected  model default values. Fixed  in booking payment logic. Debugged and fixed  serialization issues for admin dashboard. Resolved  404 by renaming to  and fixing route priority. Updated  and  with comprehensive data. Modified  and  to support hierarchical selection. Added vehicle management and admin models/endpoints.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    - **Importance**: Main React component, handles routing, global state, UI layout, and integrates other components. Originally replaced by  which was later merged back.
    - **Changes Made**: Integrated  component by adding a conditional display and a button in the Profile tab. Corrected missing  component import. Implemented auto-rotating tourist image carousel. Refined search UI: added agency selector, additional info field, removed duplicate passenger selection. Implemented hierarchical region-department-city/chef-lieu selection (then reverted to region-city/chef-lieu). Added Wallet tab with sub-navigation in Profile. Changed payment method options, including adding Paiement sur place. Corrected reservation calculation logic. Implemented FR/EN language selector and KetchFlex footer branding.
- **/app/frontend/src/RegistrationSystem.js**:
    - **Importance**: Handles multi-level user registration UI and logic (client, agency, transporter).
    - **Changes Made**: Integrated into  for display via a modal/conditional rendering, but its internal logic was not explicitly modified in this trajectory segment.
- **/app/frontend/src/PaymentKeypad.js**:
    - **Importance**: Numeric keypad interface for payments.
    - **Changes Made**: Not directly modified in this trajectory, but its integration is implied by payment system changes.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Administrative Structure Update**: Incorporate the user-provided exact list of regions and their *chefs-lieux* from Chat Message 429 into the frontend's hierarchical selection.
- **Full English Translation**: Translate *all* application data and content (e.g., descriptions, error messages, form labels, terms) beyond just the navigation tabs.
- **Real-time Transporters and Prices**: Implement displaying real-time transporter options and prices for selected destinations.
- **Admin Access for Modifications**: Develop frontend UI for the administrative dashboard and vehicle management (backend endpoints are created).
- **Real-time Map for Localization**: Integrate real-time map functionality for vehicle tracking and location selection.
- **Policies and Conditions**: Add dedicated sections for application policies and terms.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit requests from Chat Message 410. This involved:
1. Simplifying the administrative structure in  by reverting from a 3-level (Region → Department → Chef-lieu) system back to a 2-level (Region → City/Chef-lieu) selection for both transport and courier forms.
2. Modifying payment options in  to replace Mobile Money with Paiement sur place and updating reservation rules (500 FCFA per passenger, non-refundable, balance due on-site).
3. Implementing initial translation for some UI elements (like navigation tab labels) into English.
After these code changes, the AI engineer performed a frontend test (Chat Message 428) which showed the updated search system with Region → City selection. The user then provided a new artifact (Chat Message 429) containing an exact list of regions and their *chefs-lieux* of departments, seemingly to guide the final structure of the 2-level administrative selection. The AI engineer acknowledged this artifact in Chat Message 430 and stated the intention to examine it and update the administrative structure.

<optional_next_step>
Examine the user-provided artifact (Chat Message 429) and update the administrative structure in the backend and frontend to use the exact list of regions and their chefs-lieux.
